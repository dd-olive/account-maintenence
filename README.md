A brief introduction to how to use this repository.

# Repository name: account-maintenence

A human-readable description of the promises that this account is making to the public internet

# What does this repository do?

This repository explains to a non-techincal person what the account owner promises to do with this account, in terms of keeping it secure and making sure that other people on the internet can trust it.

# Why is it important?

Digital signatures involve a lot of hard-to-understand detail, but when it's done right, they are very difficult to fake. Github has an existing implementation of digital signatures that is decently easy to use, and a user interface that a non-techincal person can understand. If that non-technical person trusts Github's implementation of digial signatures and their own understanding of the user interface, they should be able to verify that certain accounts did certain things to documents and code. That knowledge might inform decisions.

# What technical limitations are there?

This account might get stolen. Github does a bunch of stuff that tries to prevent that, but nothing is guaranteed.
Github might have done something wrong. A big reason to use the Github signature mechanism is that they are really good that their jobs, though, so that is unlikely.
Technology is always developing, including techniques for faking things. This repository provides as much information as it can to help people make an informed decision about whether or not to trust this account, but you can never be sure about anything.
